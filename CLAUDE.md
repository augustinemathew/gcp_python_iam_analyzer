# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

GCP SDK IAM Permission Detector — statically analyzes Python source code to detect GCP SDK method calls and resolves each call to the IAM permissions it checks at runtime. Uses tree-sitter for Python parsing.

## Architecture

Two-phase system: **build time** (offline) and **run time** (analysis). See DESIGN.md for the full design and docs/ for component details.

### Runtime (the hot path)

```
Load 3 JSON files → "google.cloud" in source? → tree-sitter parse → walk imports → walk calls → resolve
```

Runtime must be fast. All expensive work (SDK introspection, Gemini inference) happens at build time and ships as static JSON. The scanner loads JSON and parses source — nothing else.

### Build time

Generates static artifacts checked into the repo:
- `service_registry.json` — 62 services, modules, IAM prefixes
- `iam_permissions.json` — method→permission mappings
- `method_db.json` — pre-built method signature database
- `iam_role_permissions.json` — 12,879 valid IAM permissions (ground truth)

## Key Conventions

- **Service naming**: `service_id` derived from pip package name (strip `google-cloud-`, remove hyphens). `service_id` != `iam_prefix` for many services (e.g. `kms` → `cloudkms`).
- **Permission keys**: `{service_id}.{class_name}.{method_name}` with `*` wildcard for class.
- **Import-aware**: No `google.cloud` imports in a file = no findings. Zero false positives.

## Commands

```bash
make dev                                       # install editable + dev deps
make test                                      # run all tests
make lint                                      # ruff check
make fmt                                       # ruff format + fix
pytest tests/test_scanner.py -k "test_query"   # run one test

# CLI
gcp-sdk-detector scan app.py src/              # scan files
gcp-sdk-detector scan --json app.py            # JSON output
gcp-sdk-detector services                      # list 62 services
gcp-sdk-detector permissions --service storage # show storage mappings

# Build pipeline
GEMINI_API_KEY=... python -m build.build_permission_mapping --merge
GEMINI_API_KEY=... python -m build.fix_registry_metadata
```

## How to Make Changes

Follow the process a Google engineer would use:

### 1. Measure first

Before changing anything, instrument and gather data. Don't assume — verify.

```python
# Add temporary timing to find the bottleneck
t0 = time.perf_counter()
result = expensive_function()
print(f"expensive_function: {(time.perf_counter()-t0)*1000:.1f}ms", file=sys.stderr)
```

Example finding from this project: SDK introspection (`build_method_db`) takes 13.4s at startup. The actual file scanning takes 17ms for 25 files. Startup is 99.7% of wall time. This led to the decision to pre-build the method DB as a static JSON file.

### 2. Design, then build

Write down what you'll change and why before writing code. Update the relevant doc in `docs/` or add to DESIGN.md open questions. Get the design right — the code follows.

### 3. TDD

Write a failing test that captures the desired behavior. Then implement. Then refactor. `make test && make lint` before any change is done.

### 4. Delete what you don't need

If something is superseded, remove it. No backward-compat shims, no "just in case" code, no orphan files. Every line must earn its place.

### 5. Clean up after yourself

Delete temp files. Remove debug instrumentation after experiments. Track what you create.

## Python Style

Follows the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html):

### Naming
- `module_name`, `function_name`, `ClassName`, `CONSTANT_NAME`, `_private`

### Types
- Type hints on all signatures. `X | None` over `Optional[X]`. `from __future__ import annotations` everywhere.
- `frozen=True` dataclasses for value objects. `field(default_factory=list)` for mutable defaults.

### Well-factored code
- **Functions should be small and focused.** If a function exceeds ~40 lines, break it up. Each function should do one thing.
- **One screen rule.** A reader should understand a function without scrolling. If you can't see the whole function at once, it's too long.
- **Extract, don't nest.** If a block of logic has a clear name, make it a function. Prefer flat call chains over deep nesting.
- **Break up when:** errors are hard to debug, you want to reuse a piece, or the function is hard to name because it does too many things.
- **Don't break up when:** splitting would just scatter related logic across unrelated functions, making the flow harder to follow.

### General
- Catch specific exceptions. f-strings for formatting. Properties over getters.
- No classes when a function will do. No abstractions for one-time operations.
- Docstring mandatory for: public API, nontrivial size, non-obvious logic.

### Current violations to fix
These functions exceed 40 lines and should be refactored:
- `s06_permission_mapping.py:map_permissions()` — 204 lines. Split into: load/init, auto-resolve, batch loop, post-process.
- `stats.py:analyze_artifacts()` — 193 lines. Split into per-artifact analyzers.
- `stats.py:print_report()` — 86 lines. Split into per-section printers.
- `s02_fix_metadata.py:fix_metadata()` — 104 lines. Split into: fetch corrections, apply corrections.
- `s07_validate.py:validate_mappings()` — 102 lines. Split into: build index, validate, report.

## Testing

- Test file mirrors source: `src/.../foo.py` → `tests/test_foo.py`
- `class TestFeatureName:` to group related tests
- Fixtures in `conftest.py`
- Mock external boundaries (network, filesystem, importlib)
- `@pytest.mark.slow` for integration tests
- Test the sad path

## Working as a Design Partner

When acting as a design partner (not just implementing):
- **Measure first.** Run small experiments on a single service before generalizing.
- **Track assumptions.** Every design decision rests on an assumption. Document what's validated vs. assumed.
- **Document fallbacks.** For every extraction strategy, define what happens when it fails. Nothing should be a hard dependency.
- **Update `docs/build-pipeline-v2.md`** as the single source of truth for v2 design, experiments, and decisions.
- **Capture experiment results in the doc** — not just success/failure but sample data, per-query breakdowns, and key findings.
- **Run experiments in `/tmp`**, not in the project. Don't modify project files during exploration.

## Build Pipeline v2

See `docs/build-pipeline-v2.md` for the full design. Key context:
- v2 enriches LLM prompts with REST URIs extracted from SDK source code
- 57/70 packages are gapic (REST endpoints in `rest_base.py`), 3 hand-written, 6 no REST transport, 4 infrastructure
- Local embeddings (bge-small-en-v1.5, 33M params) replace Gemini API embeddings
- `data/iam_roles.json` will replace `iam_role_permissions.json` with full role metadata
- Fallback chain: REST URI → span_name/docstring → embedding search → resource filter → v1 baseline

## Dependencies

- Python 3.12+, tree-sitter, aiofiles, pytest, ruff
- Build pipeline: google-genai SDK (`gemini-3-flash-preview`), anthropic SDK (Claude for gap-filling)
- Build pipeline (v2): sentence-transformers, BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 (local embeddings)
- 70 GCP service packages installed for introspection
